# odin-admin-dashboard

A project for creating an admin dashboard page for [The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript). The page is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A live version can be viewed [on GitHub pages](https://studsministern.github.io/odin-admin-dashboard/). Most of the document structure is made using Flexbox Grid. JavaScript is also used to make the star- and watch-later buttons toggleable.

**Note:** Functionality is not added to most links and buttons as they are simply meant to showcase the dashboard page in itself.
